```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

Let's now try to read in some data:

```{r data}
litters_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_def = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)

#janitor::clean_names takes the clean_names function from the janitor package
#instead of having to load the whole janitor package
```

Take a look at the data by just printing in the cosole
```{r}
litters_def
```
